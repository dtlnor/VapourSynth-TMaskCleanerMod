## TMaskCleanerMod for VapourSynth ##
A really simple mask cleaning plugin for AviSynth based on mt_hysteresis. It discards all areas of less than **length** pixels with values bigger or equal to **thresh**. Original plugin by tp7.

## Example usage ##
```tmcm.TMaskCleanerMod(clip, length=5, thresh=235, fade=0)```

Original plugin works only with 8 bit input (and only Y plane). My port should support 10-16 bit as well (only plane 0 will be processed, 1 and 2 will be copied).
